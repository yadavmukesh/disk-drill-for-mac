Disk Drill Media Recovery
Option #1: The easiest way.

If you want to recover your data now, without creating an uncompressed disk image and just making as few clicks as possible: once our data recovery app is installed from the Mac App Store, you just need to download this helper app (~700KB) and run it. By installing it, you just allowed our app to access and list all your disks and partitions in a usual way.

This helper app is digitally signed by Apple, completely safe to install and use! It’s distributed from our secure servers, developed by our own CleverFiles team, the same developers who brought Disk Drill Media Recovery and Data Recovery Essential to the Mac App Store. It’s provided in a PKG file and installs in seconds. Once deployed, just launch your data recovery app, and all your disks are ready for recovery: internal or external, cameras, USB drives, etc. Almost all regular features become available to you.

Alternatively, just download Disk Drill Basic from our website, drag it to your Applications folder, run just once, and your CleverFiles apps from the Mac App Store will be granted the needed access level. That’s it. Happy recovering!
